NYU Engage is the main campus-wide platform used and it can show a list of clubs that are available at NYU and provide reminders for upcoming events. A newer option is using the NYU student hub on Discord which can make it easy to discover more active clubs on campus. There are also the individual school club discovery pages though they often are not kept up to date (ex. CAS and Tandon).","permalink":"/nyu-cs-wiki/docs/All/clubs"},{"id":"Tandon/huss","title":"HUSS","description":"As part of the general education requirements for students at Tandon, you need to take 16 credits worth of HUSS electives.
