NYU Engage is the main campus-wide platform used and it can show a list of clubs that are available at NYU and provide reminders for upcoming events. A newer option is using the NYU student hub on Discord which can make it easy to discover more active clubs on campus. There are also the individual school club discovery pages though they often are not kept up to date (ex. CAS and Tandon).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"All/competitive_programming":{"id":"All/competitive_programming","title":"Competitive Programming","description":"Competitive programming is a great way to improve your problem solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. It is also a great way to meet other students who are interested in computer science.

Aftering applying, accepted students enroll in a VIP course in Albert like any other class. VIP can be taken for credit, usually 1. Up to 6 credits can be earned over multiple semesters. Different VIP teams have different needs and requirements. Generally, you can expect to spend a couple hours per week on VIP. VIP is a great way to get involved in research and work on a project that you are passionate about. VIP is also a great way to meet other students and faculty.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"CAS/intro":{"id":"CAS/intro","title":"CAS","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tandon/huss":{"id":"Tandon/huss","title":"HUSS","description":"As part of the general education requirements for students at Tandon, you need to take 16 credits worth of HUSS electives.
