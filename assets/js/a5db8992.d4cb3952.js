NYU Engage is the main campus-wide platform used and it can show a list of clubs that are available at NYU and provide reminders for upcoming events. A newer option is using the NYU student hub on Discord which can make it easy to discover more active clubs on campus.

CAS and Tandon).","permalink":"/docs/All/clubs"},{"id":"All/competitive_programming","title":"Competitive Programming","description":"Competitive programming is a great way to improve your problem solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.
